# `LSMfree`: an LSM tree implementation
`LSMfree` is an implementation of the *Log-Structured Merge tree* data structure. Log-Structured Merge Trees have gained immense popularity in the recent years. The amount of data that companies have to deal with today, and the rate with which they are generated, have created the need for heavily optimized structures that are able to *i*. provide vast write throughput and, at the same time, *ii*. provide efficient read performance. LSM trees are such a structure; they are able to provide asynchronous and highly efficient writes, while having special indexing structures (in particular, *bloom filters* and *fence pointers*), in order to provide efficient reads. We present an optimized implementation of such a structure, which we call `LSMfree`.
